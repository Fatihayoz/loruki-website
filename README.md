# Copy of loruki-website

This week's class-13-14-3 group project is to build an accessible & responsive clone of loruki-website, a fake cloud hosting website created by ![Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website). We don't expect for all the buttons to have the same behavior, but visually the site should be identical to the real loruki-website.

To run this project out we will divide loruki-website into many small parts. Each part will be developed in a different branch for each member of the group and at the end of the work we will have to merge all the branches to the main/master branch. Each part will have its own developemnt strategy and we can follow each progress in the project board named ![class-13-14-group-3: Loruki-Website](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-13-14/projects/1)
